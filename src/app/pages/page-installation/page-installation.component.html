  <h2>Drink water</h2>
  <p>
    Cold water supply doesn't require any special considerations, but if you live in the countryside, you may have a
    local source available. On the other hand, for hot or warm water supply in sinks and showers, a central heating
    system is necessary. It involves a central <tag [tag]="Tag.warmWaterBuffer"> warm water buffer</tag> tank that
    utilizes various heat sources, enabling hot water and even heating throughout the house.

  <h2>Heating</h2>
  <p>
    Floor heating is the most suitable heating option for a passive house, which has minimal heat loss and receives
    energy from the sun, people, and machines. In colder climates, some heating may be required in extreme winters, and
    a heat-pump is the best way to warm up the low-heat water used for floor heating.
    It might share with domestic hot water a <tag [tag]="Tag.warmWaterBuffer"> warm water buffer</tag> tank.

  <h2>Electricity</h2>
  <p>

    While achieving complete off-grid living may be difficult, we can greatly reduce our electricity usage by utilizing
    solar panels.

    <br><br>
    This Mansard roof is a (near) perfect angle for solar panels. However the to make it look nice is harder. We are
    still looking for the right panel types with old, classical roof tiles. If space allows it, you can put the panels
    on the ground away from the house
    <br><br>
    There is a balance between the time you need electricity (evening, electricity-car & cooking) and when they produce
    the most (around noon). If you can return-to-net, an orientation to noon is the best. Otherwise some panels may be
    more beneficial facing westward. Storing excess energy in the <tag [tag]="Tag.warmWaterBuffer"> warm water
      buffer
    </tag> works like a battery.

<section [id]="Section.installationGreyWater">
  <h2>Grey water</h2>
  <p>
    Climate adaptation requires the conservation of water, which can be achieved by collecting rainwater and using it as
    a buffer during droughts. Rainwater, which has low calcium levels, is perfect for watering plants, flushing toilets,
    and washing clothes. A large water tank (10m<sub>3</sub>), pump, and three-filter system are needed to store and
    filter the rainwater.
    <br><br>
    To ensure continuous water supply, a machine can automatically switch to normal drinking water backup if the
    rainwater tank runs out.

    <br><br>In theory showering with rainwater seems perfect, but most laws forbids to bend cold-rainwater with
    warm-drinkwater. If you do, you need less soap and your hair will be smooth. It might be different at your location

<section [id]="Section.installationVentilation">
  <h2>Ventilation</h2>
  <p>
    In passive houses, the air-tight construction plays a crucial role in conserving heat. By using advanced blow-in and
    suck-out ventilation systems, up to 94% of heat energy can be recovered and redistributed throughout the house,
    resulting in significant energy savings.

    <br><br> Air-tight?! than I can't open my windows..
    There is a common misconception that passive houses don't allow for opening windows. However, if the outside
    temperature is close to the inside temperature, it is perfectly fine to do so. Nevertheless, a well-designed climate
    system can provide clean, filtered air and eliminate the need for open windows. This is especially useful for people
    with allergies or in areas with high levels of smog.

    <br><br>
    To achieve a healthy indoor air quality, the ventilation system is designed to provide fresh air to some rooms, like
    the living room and sleeping rooms, while extracting air from wet rooms and the kitchen. The system is balanced to
    ensure efficient airflow throughout the house.
    Some rooms get fresh air, living room, sleeping rooms. And some rooms the air is pumped out, the wet rooms and
    kitchen.

<section [id]="Section.installationSmartHome">
  <h2>Domotica / Smart home</h2>
  <p>
    As homes become more complex, they should also become more intelligent. Automated air and heating systems that
    operate seamlessly in the background can enhance your comfort without you even noticing. For instance, on hot days,
    smart sunscreens can come down automatically to keep the interior cool, while they retract when it rains.
    <br><br>

    While a basic level of intelligence is necessary, there's room to enhance automation with features like automatic
    lighting. However, "smart homes" can cause some frustration, as not all situations require voice commands or
    smartphone operation; sometimes a simple button will do the trick. <br>
    Despite this, a smart home with advanced capabilities should be able to determine when you need to turn on the
    lights.
    <br><br>Think of (all if over rulable)
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The lights dim more in the evening</li>
    <li>Red nightlight in the toilet after 23:00</li>
    <li>Block the sunlight with screens</li>
    <li>Randomly turning on lights when you're away can create the illusion that someone is at home</li>
    <li>Remote controllable (local VPN not via cloud)</li>
    <li>More secure, camera's and alarms</li>
  </ul>

  <br><br>
  <p>
    Wi-Fi is great, but cables offer better performance. If you are building a new home, consider installing more
    internet cables than you think you'll need. A smart home can use internet cables for sensors, cameras, computers,
    and more. Cat 6 cables are a good choice because they are easy to work with and provide fine speeds for most
    applications, as long as the distance is not too long (over 30 meters or so). For work or gaming stations, you may
    want to consider using a higher quality cable. Shielded cables are not necessary for home use, as they are more
    expensive and harder to work with
