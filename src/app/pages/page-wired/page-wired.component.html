  <h1>Smart home</h1>
  <p>
    In addition to being a regular home, this house is also a smart home that employs a lot of domotics. This involves
    the use of many sensors and lights that can be controlled remotely. Wired -cloudless- connections are typically more
    reliable and affordable than wireless options such as Wi-Fi, which means that the setup may differ from what you're
    familiar with.

    <span>Normal - 230v</span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Europe (230v), sockets usually share a breaker or a group that is rated at either 16 or 10 amperes. The rating
    depends on the load and wire thickness, which is 2.5mm2 and 1.5mm2, respectively.

  </h3>
  <p>
    The unusual symbol you're seeing is a <tag>perilex</tag> plug, which typically contains three phases, though some
    models may only have two. The main objective of this plug is to distribute the load over three wires, rather than
    one, which requires the use of more wires. This type of plug is commonly used for high-power appliances such as
    induction cookers in the kitchen. Electric cars do not utilize this plug, but they do require three-phase power in
    most cases.

  <p>
    Lamp outlets are available in both 230V and 24V variants. Typically, most lamps can be dimmed, and their wiring runs
    back to the server room.
    They are controlled by a <tag>hub</tag> that is connected to the home automation system.

    The double pulse switches have six different options available. You can program actions for two single presses, two
    double presses, and two long presses. The switches operate at 24V, and their wiring runs back to the <tag>hub</tag>
    .

  <p>

    The dimmer switch enables you to adjust the brightness of the room's lighting. However, the smart-home system should
    automatically select the appropriate dimming level based on the time of day, see <a
      href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/circadian-lighting-custom-component/61246">circadian lightning.</a>.
    You can override this automation by using the dimmer switch.

  <p>
    To outsiders, it may seem strange, but each fixed light in the house has its own separate mini-socket. In Sweden, an
    old standard was in use, but since 2019, they have followed the EU standard of DLC.

  <p>
    To protect against high sun radiation in summer, a passive house must be equipped with sun blinds/screens. The
    screens can be passive or automatically controlled by the smart-home system. External screens are more effective
    than internal screens.

    This water has low calcium levels, making it ideal for watering plants and gardens. It can also be used for flushing
    toilets and washing machines, reducing the amount of soap required. While it doesn't need to be drinkable, it's
    still a valuable resource that shouldn't be wasted.

    The mixing of warm-drink water and cold rainwater is not permitted when using water from a supply company, due to
    the high risk of flow back. However, the use of rainwater has benefits such as reducing the amount of water used,
    requiring less soap, and resulting in softer hair.
